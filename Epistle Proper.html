        <p>I dont even know where to start from but lets sha from somewhere.
            And if i say i want to write as my mind is leading we wont leave here. well lets sha start. You've been a gee since I got closer to you.
            .....First of all let's take it from the top .....Day one wasn't so nice cause you were one tiny sharp mouthed rat...anytime I remember that day I just burst into laughter and be like sheyy na me girl do like that sha...big and cute boy like me ahhh my life....I never even thought we could become this close cause I was even I won't say shy but I wasn't feeling so confident talking to you after that incident cause I was thinking you might shun me up since you already did that without me even saying a word to you and even the people you roll with then...so I was like let her just pass ... I just wanted to know the girl that shuned me up cause I was still in shock ...let me even burst your head I crammed your number when that attendance stuff was passed by barrimati cause I insisted on knowing you and since then I've not forgotten and I don't think I'd ever forgett....... but look at what that single step has brought.....that single step brought a big blessing into my lifeeee....I never even knew you sef be psycho but you still dey learn for where we we deyðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ...you're one crazy beautiful baby of mine....Even though sometimes you fight me but it's all love and I'm even happy it has reduced it just shows we are getting mature.....I've never had a dull moment with you and I never get tired talking or even calling you....
            I never and would never regret meeting...meeting you has been a blessing and would forever be a blessing....thank you for the care you always show me ....thank you for always been there for me whenever I need you even if its not convenient for you....thank you for trusting in me and I'd never want to loose your trust anytime.....I could remember when we started sitting together during diploma that you always disturb me during class.....remember the time that lecturer wanted to send us from the class when we were playing love ... you've been a clown since day one and a very very red hotted stubborn rat ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚....Thank you for being my friend .....Thank you for everything the care the love i really appreciate the and i promise not ever take you for granted.....Happy birthday love ....I love you so muchhhh....Enjoy your day sweetheart
